# Casual Convert

Casual and convenient mutli-currency conversion estimation tool.

## Try It

[https://cc.finnika.app](https://cc.finnika.app).

It is especially useful if you are browsing (or applying to) different roles from countries all over the world and what to get quick estimate of salary in USD and your local currency.

### Limitations

* it is running on **free** instances at [render.com](render.com). I'm really curious how it will handle heavier load. Please, don't be mad, if it does not.
* Currency conversion rates are cached and can be between few hours and few days old. Tool is good quick ballpark estimation comparison, not for exact conversion/exchange.
